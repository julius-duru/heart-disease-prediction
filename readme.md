Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning:  https://online-heart-disease-prediction.streamlit.app/
 Project Overview

Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide. Early detection plays a crucial role in prevention and effective treatment.
This project builds an end-to-end Machine Learning pipeline to predict the likelihood of heart disease using clinical and demographic data, and deploys the model as an interactive Streamlit web application.

The solution covers:

Data preprocessing and feature engineering

Model training and evaluation

Model persistence (joblib)

Interactive prediction UI using Streamlit

Objectives

Predict whether a patient is at risk of heart disease

Provide probability-based confidence scores

Build a deployable and reproducible ML system

Model Persistence

The trained artifacts are saved using joblib:

model_data = {
    "model": model,
    "feature_names": X.columns.tolist()
}
joblib.dump(model_data, "heart_disease_model.pkl")

## Meanings of Medical Terms with High Impact on the Research

# These four clinical terms strongly induce diseases on patients evaluated

1. Chest Pain (cp – Chest Pain Type)

This refers to discomfort or pain felt in the chest, often related to reduced blood flow to the heart muscle.

Common categories include:

Typical angina – Classic heart-related chest pain, usually triggered by exertion or stress.

Atypical angina – Chest pain with some, but not all, features of classic angina.

Non-anginal pain – Chest pain not related to the heart (e.g., muscle or digestive causes).

Asymptomatic – No chest pain present.

2. restecg (Resting Electrocardiogram Results)

This describes the electrical activity of the heart measured while the patient is at rest.

Common values:

Normal – No visible abnormalities.

ST-T wave abnormality – May indicate heart muscle ischemia or electrolyte imbalance.

Left ventricular hypertrophy – Thickening of the heart’s left ventricle, often due to high blood pressure.

3. thalach (Maximum Heart Rate Achieved)

This represents the highest heart rate (beats per minute) reached during exercise or stress testing.

Lower values may indicate poor cardiovascular fitness or heart disease.

Higher values generally suggest better heart performance, depending on age.

4. slope (Slope of the Peak Exercise ST Segment)

This refers to the pattern of the ST segment on an ECG during peak exercise, which helps assess heart stress.

Types:

Upsloping – Usually normal or low risk.

Flat – May indicate moderate heart disease.

Downsloping – Strongly associated with myocardial ischemia (reduced blood flow to the heart).
